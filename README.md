# Battleship

This project was based on the popular board game 'Battleship'.  The requirements were to create a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) that allowed a user to play Battleship through the command line.  This project cemented object oriented programming techniques for me.
